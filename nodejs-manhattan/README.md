### Problem statement
<BR>
We want build the next revolutionaty ridesharing app with baking integration. Where your bankapp, is fully integrated with the ride sharing and as more as you ride less interest(APR)
you pay. However we need to start small and do the same solution as people use to measure distance in the chess board. So we need start by measure distance. Create a solution that given several coordinates(x,y) you can tell us the distance. One big tip: The Manhattan Distance FTW to measure the distance between two points. Formula:
<BR>
```<BR>
(X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) is given by |X1 – X2| + |Y1 – Y2|.

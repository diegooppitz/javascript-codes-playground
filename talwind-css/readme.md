Tailspin - A Tailwind CSS Clone in TypeScript

Description:

Tailwind CSS has become a popular utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. In this coding challenge, you are tasked with creating a simplified clone of Tailwind CSS using TypeScript. We'll call this clone "Tailspin." Your goal is to implement a basic set of utility classes and a responsive design system similar to Tailwind CSS, using TypeScript to ensure type safety and better developer experience.

Objectives:

Implement a set of utility classes for styling elements, including:

Spacing (margin and padding)
Typography (font size, font weight, line height, and text alignment)
Colors (background, text, and border colors)
Borders (border width, border radius, and border style)
Flexbox and Grid layout utilities
Create a responsive design system using breakpoints similar to Tailwind CSS:

Small (640px)
Medium (768px)
Large (1024px)
Extra Large (1280px)
Allow users to extend or customize the configuration, including:

Adding custom breakpoints
Modifying default values (e.g., spacing, colors, fonts)
Ensure type safety and autocompletion support with TypeScript.

Requirements:

Use TypeScript for the implementation.

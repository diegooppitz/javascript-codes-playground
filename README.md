### JavaScript Codes Playground

Thank you for visiting my JavaScript Codes Playground! This repository is a collection of various study projects where I explore and practice coding with Vanilla JS and Node.js. Each folder within this repository represents a unique project, focusing on different aspects and functionalities.

#### Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a learning and experimentation space. By working on these projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals and backend development with Node.js, as well as improve my problem-solving skills and coding proficiency.
